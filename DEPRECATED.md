# ⚠️ DEPRECATED — Merged into RusingAcademy Ecosystem Main Repo

**Date:** February 17, 2026  
**Wave:** Wave 2 — Learner Portal Integration

---

## Status: DEPRECATED

This repository (`RusingAcademy-Learner-Portal`) has been **fully integrated** into the unified [RusingAcademy Ecosystem Main Repo](https://github.com/RusingAcademy/RusingAcademy-Ecosystem-Main-Repo).

All 70 pages and 77 components from this repository are present in the main ecosystem repository.

## Integration Summary

| Metric | Learner Portal | Main Repo | Overlap |
|--------|---------------|-----------|---------|
| Pages | 70 | 333 | 64/70 (91%) |
| Components | 77 | 358 | 77/77 (100%) |
| Server Files | 49 | 378 | 23/49 (47%) |

The 6 pages unique to this repo (AdminCommerce, AdminCourses, AdminDashboardHome, AdminKPIs, AdminMarketing, AdminUsers) are simplified versions of more comprehensive pages already in the main repo.

## Where to Find the Code Now

- **Repository:** [RusingAcademy-Ecosystem-Main-Repo](https://github.com/RusingAcademy/RusingAcademy-Ecosystem-Main-Repo)
- **Learner Dashboard:** `/dashboard/learner` or `/learner`
- **All learner routes:** `/programs`, `/flashcards`, `/achievements`, `/sle-practice`, etc.

## Do NOT Make Changes Here

All new development should be done in the main repository. This repo is preserved as a historical reference only.
